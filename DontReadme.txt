Grab you code and getting mad,
raise you worries on the fist step
just commit yo'shit
to that buggy branch of the git

Should I write that little test?
And that crappy line is a your blame
Code can be so sleek,
on the buggy side of the street.

I used to wrote in the IDE with the tests as facade
No longer afraid, 'cause it has failed, forever 

If I never has a pass, I'd be rich as Zuckerberger,
All those feats 'round my feet on the filyhy, buggy branch of the git
